## Summary

    This is a two part project. Below I will describe some major problems in today's society that I want to attempt to combat through this app.

    With the rise of artifical intelligence, photoshop, and the political climate we live in today, it has become increasingly difficult to tell what is real and what is fake. The purpose of this app is to help users distinguish between real photos and fake photos. 

    Another major issue that we face is the rise in fake job postings. A lot of people fall for fake job postings and and up getting scammed. I will use artifical intelligence to attempt to combat these fake job postings.

    With this app, I hope to assist you in determining what's real,and what's not.
