# IsItAI

## Summary

   Here's an improved version:

---

**What's Real** is a two-part project aimed at addressing critical issues in today's society. Below, I outline some of the major challenges this app seeks to combat.

In our current era, the rise of artificial intelligence, advanced photo editing tools like Photoshop, and a polarized political climate have made it increasingly difficult to discern what is real from what is fake. The primary goal of this app is to empower users to differentiate between authentic and manipulated images.

Additionally, the prevalence of fake job postings has become a significant concern. Many people fall victim to these scams, often resulting in financial loss or identity theft. This app will leverage artificial intelligence to identify and mitigate the spread of fraudulent job listings.

Through **What's Real**, I aim to provide you with the tools to determine what's genuine and what isn't, helping you navigate a world where reality is often blurred.

### Issues

The API I used to test whether or not the photo is AI generated can only tell if the photo is AI generated, but it does not detect if an image was photoshopped or not. That is not the job up that API, I must research API that will tell if it was photoshopped as well. 

 ** Updated: This JPEG Snoop may allow me to help detect whether an image was photoshopped:
